### `npm run dev`

## Requirements

Ensure a successful implementation, the project has been defined through user stories, which outline the required functionality from both the customer and admin perspectives. Some of the key user stories include:

-   Viewing a list of venues
-   Searching for a specific venue
-   Viewing detailed information about a venue
-   Accessing a calendar with available dates for a venue
-   Registering as a customer and creating bookings
-   Managing bookings and upcoming reservations
-   Registering as a venue manager and managing venues
-   Updating avatars and logging in/out

### Some features added

-   Autofill with google places api
-   View venue location in map
    These features will not work when installed locally, as they require api keys.
